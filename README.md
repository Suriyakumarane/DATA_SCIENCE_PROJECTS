# CARDECKO USED CAR PRICE PREDICTION:
    PROBLEM STATEMENT:
      To create a data science solution for predicting used car prices accurately by analyzing a diverse dataset including car model, no. of owners, age, mileage, fuel type, kilometers driven, features and location. The aim is to build a machine learning model that offers users to find current valuations for used cars.
# COPPER INDUSTRIAL MODELLING:
    PROBLEM STATEMENT:
      The copper industry deals with less complex data related to sales and pricing. However, this data may suffer from issues such as skewness and noisy data, which can affect the accuracy of manual predictions. Dealing with these challenges manually can be time-consuming and may not result in optimal pricing decisions. A machine learning regression model can address these issues by utilizing advanced techniques such as data normalization, feature scaling, and outlier detection, and leveraging algorithms that are robust to skewed and noisy data. 
Another area where the copper industry faces challenges is in capturing the leads. A lead classification model is a system for evaluating and classifying leads based on how likely they are to become a customer . You can use the STATUS variable with WON being considered as Success and LOST being considered as Failure and remove data points other than WON, LOST STATUS values.
# SINGAPORE FLAT RESALE PRICE PREDICTION:
    PROBLEM STATEMENT:
      To develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application that predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore. This predictive model will be based on historical data of resale flat transactions, and it aims to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.
